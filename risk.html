            <h1>Reason for using Questionnarie</h1>
            <p>1-Consideration for respondents<br>
              The format of questionnaires is close-ended. Therefore, it is easier for respondents to answer and lower the risk of respondents losing patience.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>2-Consideration for group members<br>
                Close-ended questionnaires are also easier for analyze. As there are less irrelevant, complicated and confused answer (open-ended questions) received from respondents, group members are able to analyze and compare the results efficiently.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              3-Consideration for results’ reliability <br>
              Questionnaires reduce bias and intrusion when comparing to face-to-face interviews and group interviews. Questions in questionnaires avoid leading questions and thus, reduce bias as to ensure reliability of the result. Moreover, there is no research data or opinions from other respondents to interrupt one respondents from answering the questionnaire. Therefore, results are more reliable.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Target Group</h1>
            <p>
              Invited respondents are university students and also, smartphone users aged 18-23 in order to find out their experiences in using smartphones and their awareness of the privacy risk and security associated with using smartphones.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h1>Distribution</h1>
            <p>
              Paper-based questionnaires were distributed on the 9th March 2017. To ensure the respondents are solely university students, the above-mentioned method was adopted. For online surveys, no doubt, it is relatively cost-effective and time-effective, however, unwanted responses from other groups of people may be received. This may cause time to separate the unwanted responses.
